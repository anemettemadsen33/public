# Auto Marketplace Professional - World-Class Upgrade

This document outlines the comprehensive upgrade plan to transform this repository into a world-class automotive marketplace frontend.

## 📋 Scope & Reality Check

The full "master prompt" specification would require **weeks of development** to implement completely. This includes:

- Complete TypeScript migration (~30+ files)
- MSW mock server with 300+ vehicles
- Enhanced motion design system
- Virtualized components
- 3 additional languages
- Comprehensive test suites
- Dozens of new components

## ✅ Phase 1: Foundation & DX (COMPLETED)

### Development Experience

- ✅ **TypeScript** - Configured with strict mode
- ✅ **ESLint** - TypeScript-aware linting with recommended rules
- ✅ **Prettier** - Consistent code formatting
- ✅ **Husky** - Pre-commit hooks with lint-staged
- ✅ **Vitest** - Unit testing framework configured
- ✅ **Playwright** - E2E testing framework configured
- ✅ **Lighthouse CI** - Performance budgets and monitoring

### CI/CD Pipeline

- ✅ **GitHub Actions** - Full CI workflow with:
  - Code quality checks (TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier)
  - Unit tests with coverage
  - E2E tests (Playwright)
  - Build artifacts
  - Lighthouse CI for performance monitoring

### Build & Performance

- ✅ **Bundle Analyzer** - rollup-plugin-visualizer for bundle analysis
- ✅ **Enhanced PWA** - vite-plugin-pwa with runtime caching
- ✅ **Bundle Budgets** - Configured for optimal performance

### New npm Scripts

```bash
npm run typecheck      # TypeScript type checking
npm run lint           # ESLint (error on warnings)
npm run lint:fix       # Auto-fix linting issues
npm run format         # Format code with Prettier
npm run format:check   # Check code formatting
npm run test           # Run unit tests with Vitest
npm run test:ui        # Vitest UI
npm run test:coverage  # Coverage report
npm run test:e2e       # E2E tests with Playwright
npm run test:e2e:ui    # Playwright UI
npm run analyze        # Bundle size analysis
```
